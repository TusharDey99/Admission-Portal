# Admission-Portal
Our project name is Admission Portal. Itâ€™s a public university admission portal which will enable students to go through the complete process of their admission exams. Now this sounds familiar because it already exists.
Let us revisit how we to go through the whole admission process:
  1. Students went to the website of their selected applicable public university.
  2. They filled in an admission form with correct and relevant information regarding their academic career.
  3. They submitted it and waited for update on their admission exam center and serial number.
  4. After knowing their admission exam center and serial number they had to go to that particular city where the university is located in order to attend the examination.
The above-mentioned process is pretty tedious and tiresome. Hence, we are introducing an entirely different admission exam system for public universities. The new rules and regulations for attending Public University exams are as follows
  1. The students will provide their required academic information to this system.
  2. The system itself will do the rest. It will calculate their GPAs and will provide them names of applicable public universities according to their grades.
  3. Students can choose any of the applicable university and apply for admission exam.
  4. After paying the admission fee, students will instantly receive their nearest pre-selected exam location which will be based on the location of their colleges from which they      attended HSC exam. It will also provide their exam ID, hall number and date.
  5. They will also be provided with additional choices on if they want to book a student dorm room near exam center or any kind of other rental service.
